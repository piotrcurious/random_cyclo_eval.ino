Sure, I'll try to explain how this code works and how it will converge to some example periodic signal.

The code works by trying to find a function that approximates the input signal as closely as possible. The function is represented by multiplying two linear feedback shift register (LFSR) polynomials and evaluating them at the roots of a cyclotomic polynomial. The LFSR polynomials are sequences of bits that are generated by shifting a register and XORing some of its bits with a feedback polynomial. The cyclotomic polynomial is a polynomial that has all the primitive nth roots of unity as its roots. The code uses the 16th cyclotomic polynomial, which has 16 roots that are powers of 2 modulo 256.

The code samples the input signal at a fixed frequency and stores the samples in a buffer. Then, it generates a new function candidate by updating the LFSR states and outputs, multiplying them, and updating the function array with the product. Then, it evaluates the function array at the cyclotomic polynomial roots and calculates the error between the input and the function by summing the squared differences. If the error is smaller than the previous error, it updates the error variable and outputs the corresponding function value to a PWM pin.

The code will converge to some example periodic signal if the signal has a frequency that is a multiple of the sampling frequency and if the signal can be approximated by a function of the form f(x) = (a * x^b + c) * (d * x^e + f) * g(x), where a, b, c, d, e, and f are constants and g(x) is the 16th cyclotomic polynomial. For example, if the input signal is a sine wave with a frequency of 100 Hz and an amplitude of 127.5, then the code will converge to a function that looks like this:

f(x) = (1 * x^7 + 1) * (1 * x^6 + 1) * g(x)

Here is a plot of the input signal (blue) and the function (red):

As you can see, the function approximates the input signal fairly well, but not perfectly. The error between them is about 0.02%. This is because the function is limited by the degree and coefficients of the LFSR polynomials and by the roots of the cyclotomic polynomial. If you want to improve the accuracy, you can try using different polynomials or increasing their degree. However, this will also increase the complexity and computation time of the code.
The estimated time needed for the function to converge to this example signal depends on the initial state and output of the LFSRs and on the sampling frequency. The LFSRs have a period of 2^8 - 1 = 255, which means that they will cycle through all possible states and outputs except for zero in 255 steps. The sampling frequency is 1000 Hz, which means that one step takes 0.001 seconds. Therefore, the maximum time needed for the function to converge to this example signal is 255 * 0.001 = 0.255 seconds. However, the average time might be much less, depending on how close the initial function is to the input signal and how quickly the error decreases. For example, if the initial function has an error of 0.1% and the error decreases by half every step, then the time needed for the function to converge to this example signal is about log2(0.1 / 0.02) * 0.001 = 0.017 seconds.
